text=!!Definition and use as Page Titles%0aA WikiWord is a set of two or more words run together, where the first letter of each word is capitalized. This syntax is also sometimes referred to as "mixed case" or "camel case". WikiWords are used as '''page titles''' in a [[WikiWikiWeb]].  %0a%0a!!Use as links%0aIn some wikis, you can string any sequence of words together, capitalizing the first letter of each word, to make a valid WikiWord '''link'''. In such PmWiki installations, WikiWords surrounded by [=[=...=]=] or preceded by a backquote (`) are not turned into links: %0a%0a%0a(:linkwikiwords:)%0a(:markup:)[@LikeThis compared to `LikeThis or even [=LikeThis=]@]%0a(:nolinkwikiwords:)%0a%0aSee [[Links]] for information about `PmWiki's rules for forming links and forming page titles.%0a%0a!!!!Enabling WikiWord links%0aWikiWord links are disabled by default since Pmwiki version 2.1 beta2.
